# Classification-of-Diabetes

##Project Topic

  The topic our group chose is Diabetes. Diabetes is the 8th leading cause of death in the United States. Diabetes can be a fatal disease and is often challenging to treat. However, early-stage identification, prediction and classification of diabetes may enhance quality of life, prevent damage of internal organs and save lives. In North Carolina, the rate of diabetes amongst the population is 13%. Additionally, 35% of the adult population is considered pre-diabetic, which emphasizes the need for understanding risk factors. The admission rate for diabetes patients is 2 to 6 times higher than patients without diabetes. Understanding what risk factors lead to diabetes can help clinicians diagnose and treat patients.  As a group, we all have interest in diabetes as well as predicting potential risk factors to aid clinicians in diagnosing and treating patients which is why we chose this as our topic. 
 The questions that we hope to address include:
•	What social determinants of health are most predictive of the development of Diabetes Type 2?
o	Examples include smoking status, education level, income, physical activity, & mental health status.
•	Can certain factors help to predict if a person will develop Diabetes Type 2?
•	What risk factors are most likely to contribute to the development of Diabetes from Pre-diabetes?
 
What data sets have you identified that may assist in addressing your questions? These may change over time.
